# Intro

Hi, my name is Colin Loftus and Iâ€™m from a very boring town in North New Jersey called Chatham. I am currently a student at the University of Delaware and am a Business Undeclared major though I am very interested in exploring the marketing world. Throughout high school, I worked as a lifeguard at my local pool during the summer which not only gave me useful skills like how to perform CPR but also taught me to be responsible and accountable. Being an older brother, and one of the more experienced lifeguards at my pool, I also feel as though I have the traits and experience to be a very good leader.
